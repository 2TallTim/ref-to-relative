# Reference to Relative

A pipeline script for Maya to work with relative path references.

Run this script in the root of your project. Any file references in `.ma` files will be replaced with relative path references to the project.

Pass in a file path in the command line to have the file references be relative to another path. Pass in a single file to modify only that file's references.
